<h1>How have bike rentals changed in London</h1>
<p>As discussed in an earlier lecture, we will look at the daily cycle hires to assess the trends over time. The data source is provided by the government and covers daily Tfl cycle hires</p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx" class="uri">https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx</a></em></p>
<p>To get a better understanding of the data, we can plot out the usage by month</p>
<div id="vs.-previous-years" class="section level2">
<h2>2020 vs. Previous Years</h2>
<p>The graphs of May and June in 2020 show a much flatter curve compared to those of previous years, which suggests that bikes distribution among these two months are more even across 20k, 40k, and 60k. In terms of potential reasons behind such change, it’s likely that due to the lockdown policy in UK during the those two months of 2020, bike rentals as a result decreased dramatically. Since there has been restrictions on the use of public transportations, the bikes are rented on a much lower frenquency throughout the months.</p>

<p>If we need to find out the expected value, it always means the long term average or mean. Depending on the distribution and skewness of the data, mean can be a better estimate when the data is left or right skewed, or when the standard deviations can cancel each other off.</p>
