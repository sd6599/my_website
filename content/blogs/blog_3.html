<h1>How have bike rentals changed in London</h1>
<p>As discussed in an earlier lecture, we will look at the daily cycle hires to assess the trends over time</p>

<pre class="r"><code># Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 &lt;- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = &quot;Data&quot;,
                   range = cell_cols(&quot;A:B&quot;))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike &lt;- bike0 %&gt;% 
  clean_names() %&gt;% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %&gt;% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))</code></pre>
<p>We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.</p>

<p>Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. Whatâ€™s happening?</p>
<p>However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.</p>
<p><img src="/Users/soham/Documents/Work/LBS/Courses/DataCamp/my_website/images/tfl_monthly.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).</p>
<p><img src="/Users/soham/Documents/Work/LBS/Courses/DataCamp/my_website/images/tfl_weekly.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation <code>excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals</code>.</p>
<p>Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?</p>
